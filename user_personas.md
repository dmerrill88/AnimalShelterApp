#Veronica the Volunteer

Veronica is a retired empty nester who volunteers at the animal shelter with all the spare time that she has. She needs a way to communicate with foster parents to get pickup/drop-off times/info so she she can take them to scheduled events, routine clinic visits, and unscheduled clinic visits when she's available to transport. She is familiar with app technologies, but needs something easy to use to keep her schedule organized.


#Frank the Foster Parent

Frank is in his 20s, unmarried with no kids, and loves furry friends and giving back to the community. He is currently fostering a dog that needs to attend adoption events to find a forever home. His foster dog also needs to have routine visits at the animal shelter. Frank doesn't have time to take him to every event and routine visit so he has to arrange transport to get his foster to and from.


#Sam the Shelter Coordinator

Sam, in her 30s, is animal lover that works at the animal shelter coordinates volunteers and foster parents. She is dedicated to the cause and needs a convenient way to communicate with both foster parents and volunteers and have all of the logistics/scheduling for transportation of foster pets in one location.
